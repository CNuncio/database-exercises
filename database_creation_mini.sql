# For each scenario, select the best relationship type and why:


# - in a dating app: users and user_profiles
# one to one
# one user would (most likely) only have one profile and that one profile would only belong to that one user

# - on a health insurance portal: users and claims
# one to many
# one user may have many claims but only a specific claim will belong to an individual user

#     - in a blog application: users and posts
# depending on what kind of posts and where:
# if just talking about a post on a fb wall like a comment then
# one to many
#but can be used again with similar statuses on the same profile
# but if talking about type of post and reblogging a popular gif set maybe more like
# many to many

#     - in a social media app: users and groups
# # many to many
# many users in many groups and many ppl in a group

#     - in an app for professional networking: businesses and addresses
# many to many
# bc many business in one large building with more than one building

#     - in a dog walking app: pet_records and pet_owners
# many to many possibly bc of how many records of a pet can belong to more than one possible owners
